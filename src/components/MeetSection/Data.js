This is my second year on Tech-Knights and I am very excited to learn more about the Programming and Mechanical aspects of the robot. I enjoy participating in FIRST because I find it interesting and fun to work on a team to develop a solution to the challenge. In addition to robotics, I am part of FBLA, Key Club, Mu Alpha Theta, Literati, and National Honor Society. I look forward to a great robotics season ahead!",
